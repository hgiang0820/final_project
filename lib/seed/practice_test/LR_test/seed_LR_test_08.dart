**'Innovate Tech' Announces Quarterly Earnings**

(July 28) – 'Innovate Tech' reported its financial results for the second quarter today, showing a 12% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year. The growth was largely driven by strong sales of its flagship product, the 'ConnectPro' wireless router.

However, net profit saw a slight decline of 3%, which CEO David Chen attributed to increased spending on research and development for upcoming products. "We are investing heavily in innovation to ensure our long-term growth," Chen stated in a press release.

Despite the dip in profit, the company's stock price remained stable in after-hours trading. Innovate Tech plans to launch two new products in the fourth quarter.

Thank you for your inquiry. Yes, Elevator #1 (east) is our freight elevator.
Unfortunately, due to Elevator #2 being out of service all week, we cannot grant exclusive access to Elevator #1 during regular business hours, as it will be the only one available for all tenants.
We recommend scheduling your furniture delivery either before 8 AM or after 5 PM on May 8 to minimize disruption. Please let us know if you can arrange this with your delivery company.

**Online Review: The Corner Bistro (Posted May 4 by Mark P.)**
**Rating**: 4/5 Stars
Went here last night (May 3) with a group of friends. The renovation looks great - much brighter and more modern. The new menu is definitely a step up. I had the pan-seared salmon, which was excellent. My friends enjoyed their dishes too (steak frites, mushroom risotto). Service was a bit slow, maybe because it was a busy Friday night, but our server was very friendly. Overall, a great improvement. Will definitely be back.
