Councilmember Ana Sharma, who voted in favor, argued the tax increase is essential for funding much-needed road repairs and hiring 10 new firefighters.

Councilmember John Kline, who voted against it, expressed concern that the tax increase would be a burden on residents. He had proposed cutting the budget for the summer arts festival instead, but his amendment was not approved.
