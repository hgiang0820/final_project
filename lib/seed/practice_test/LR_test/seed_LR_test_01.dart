**Oakville Launches New Bike-Share Program**

OAKVILLE (May 2) – The city of Oakville officially launched its new public bike-sharing program today, aiming to provide a greener and more convenient transportation option for residents and visitors. The program, named "Oakville Wheels," features 200 bicycles available at 25 docking stations strategically placed near public transit hubs, parks, and commercial areas.

Users can rent a bike using the Oakville Wheels mobile app. A single 30-minute ride costs \$2, while a monthly pass offering unlimited 30-minute rides is available for \$30.

"This program is a major step towards making Oakville a more sustainable and bicycle-friendly city," said Mayor Susan Cho at the launch event. The city plans to add 10 more stations by the end of the year if the program proves popular.
