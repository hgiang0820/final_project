This is to confirm that I have booked your flight and hotel for your trip to the conference in Sydney. Your flight departs from LAX on Tuesday, December 3, at 9:00 P.M. (Flight #QA12) and arrives in Sydney on December 5 (due to the time difference).

This memo is to inform you of a change to our commission structure, effective July 1.

Starting next month, the commission rate for all sales *over* \$10,000 will be increased from 5% to 7%. The rate for sales under \$10,000 will remain at 5%.

This change is designed to reward our top performers and incentivize the sale of our larger enterprise packages.

Hi Susan,

Thanks for the update. This is great news, and I think it will be a strong motivator for the team.

I have one question. Does the new 7% rate apply to the entire sale amount, or only to the portion that is over \$10,000? For example, if I make a \$12,000 sale, is the commission 7% of \$12,000, or 5% of \$10,000 and 7% of \$2,000?

Could you please clarify?

Thanks,
